This is a C language project that I completed while taking the CSE-220 Systems Programming course taught by Ethan Blanton at The University at Buffalo.

It is a program that runs Conway's Game Of Life. An explanation of how it works can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life.

The main.c file near entirely contains code that I wrote, while all other files were provided by the professor.
